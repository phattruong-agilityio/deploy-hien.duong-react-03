# React - Practice Three

This web application manages project information, including the project name, project manager, status, date created, timeline, and estimation. It helps streamline the management and tracking of various projects by providing a clear and organized view of all relevant details.

## TARGETS

- Apply React.Context API and React.useReducer hook for state management.
- Take a narrow view to check re-rendering and optimize performance of one React application.
- Become better understood and create your own custom hook to reduce redundant code.
- Study and apply uncontrolled components in some cases to avoid needless state management gradually.
- Be aware of catching common and specific errors (errors from api, from logic,...) for one React application to prevent crashing issues dramatically.
- Check [PageSpeed] (<https://pagespeed.web.dev/>) scores frequently during development time and ensure the scores at minimum 95 points.
- Keep moving with Storybook which will assist to manage components in the development environment.
